Health 
Assessment 
Skyhigh Security Health Assessment is a service 
designed to periodically review the deployment and 
effectiveness of Skyhigh Security solutions. Given the 
dynamic nature of cloud environments, especially in 
growing enterprises, regular assessments are crucial to 
maintain optimal cloud security posture. 
The assessment process involves a comprehensive 
review 
of 
the 
Skyhigh 
Cloud 
Security 
Advisor 
Dashboard, deployed Skyhigh Security use cases, 
integration and solution statuses, Skyhigh Cloud 
Connector health, and the extent of supplementary 
Skyhigh Security feature utilization. This analysis helps 
identify potential gaps in coverage and provides 
actionable recommendations to enhance security 
architecture, optimize risk management, and improve 
overall security posture. 
The assessment delivers a detailed report outlining the 
health status of each Skyhigh Security integration and 
solution, the current state of deployed use cases, and 
specific recommendations to address identified gaps. 
This valuable information empowers you to make 
informed decisions and take proactive steps to 
strengthen your cloud security posture. 
The report is delivered in electronic format (PDF) and 
includes a readout session.
