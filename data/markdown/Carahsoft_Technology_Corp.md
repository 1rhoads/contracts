Solution Proposed: **Palo Alto Networks Cortex Xpanse**


Service Category: 4


Note: Example of **not to exceed pricing** is below. The attached SKU list will be utilized in all responses to
RFQ’s from the agencies. Specific configurations requested from the agency will determine exact SKU
and quantities needed. The attached file reflects **not to exceed**, although at the individual agency request,
additional discounts are available. As new products or features are introduced, the file will reflect the
changes.






|Tiered, not to exceed pricing for initial term: Tier|Price|Unit|
|---|---|---|
|~~Tier~~<br>|~~Price~~<br>|~~Unit~~<br>|

**Note:** Xpanse is priced per Asset Under Management (AUM). **AUM** are calculated as the sum of (1)
number of distinct IP addresses, (2) number of distinct SSL signing certificates, (3) number of distinct fully
qualified domain names, (4) number of distinct open services directly attributable to customers, and (5)
number of distinct cloud resources.  Quotes are also rounded up to the nearest hundred AUM.
