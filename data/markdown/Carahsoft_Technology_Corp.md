#### **Palo Alto**

Respondent: Carahsoft Technology Corporation


Solution Proposed: **Palo Alto Networks Cortex Xpanse**


Service Category: 4


Note: Example of **not to exceed pricing** is below. The attached SKU list will be utilized in all responses to
RFQ’s from the agencies. Specific configurations requested from the agency will determine exact SKU
and quantities needed. The attached file reflects **not to exceed**, although at the individual agency request,
additional discounts are available. As new products or features are introduced, the file will reflect the
changes.
