**Add-on services description:**


**Implementation Services**
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration process
using customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint
basis. The sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a
composition of the following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer

and serves as the basis for the cost calculation:


        - Project manager/scrum master


        - Architect


        - System engineer (s)


        - System tester (s)


        - Business analyst (s)


A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the
customer to estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration
requirements (scope) such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access

limitations, false positive tuning based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools

integration.


Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In

the event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s

Services and ultimately accepted by the Customer.


Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5
sprints = $232,385.00

**Add-on services description:**


**Implementation Services**
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration process using
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a composition of the
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for
the cost calculation:


       - Project manager/scrum master

       - Architect

       - System engineer (s)

       - System tester (s)

       - Business analyst (s)

A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task requiring
12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to estimate
the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope) such as
number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning based on
customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.


Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and
ultimately accepted by the Customer.


Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5 sprints
= $232,385.00


**Maintenance and Operations**
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an agile maintenance and operations process using
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources that includes a composition of the
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for
the cost calculation:


       - Project manager

       - System architect

       - System engineer (s)

       - Technical support engineer (s)

       - Technical trainer (s)

A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task requiring
12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to estimate
the story points based on the scope such as managed endpoints, maintenance duration, system tuning,
tickets managed, incident response timeframe and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

**Add-on services description:**





**Implementation Services**
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration process using
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a composition of the
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for
the cost calculation:


  - Project manager/scrum master


  - Architect


  - System engineer (s)


  - System tester (s)


  - Business analyst (s)


A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope)
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.


Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and
ultimately accepted by the Customer.

sprints = $232,385.00


**Maintenance and Operations**
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an agile maintenance and operations process using
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources that includes a composition of the
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for
the cost calculation:


        - Project manager


        - System architect


        - System engineer (s)


        - Technical support engineer (s)


        - Technical trainer (s)


A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to
estimate the story points based on the scope such as managed endpoints, maintenance duration, system
tuning, tickets managed, incident response timeframe and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).


Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and
ultimately accepted by the Customer.

**Add-on services description:**


**Implementation Services**
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration process using
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a composition of the
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for
the cost calculation:
Project manager/scrum master
Architect
System engineer (s)
System tester (s)
Business analyst (s)
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope)
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and
ultimately accepted by the Customer.
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5
sprints = $232,385.00

A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope)
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and
ultimately accepted by the Customer.
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5
sprints = $232,385.00
