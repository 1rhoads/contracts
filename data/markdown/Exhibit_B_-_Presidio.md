Invoicing
• CLIENT is invoiced for hardware (“goods”) upon shipment from the manufacturer and shall accept and pay for partial shipments. Software is invoiced upon shipment of media 
or when download capability is provided. OEM services are billed per the OEM SOW. Presidio services are billed per the Presidio SOW.
• Usage-Based Services Terms and Conditions. For Usage-Based Services purchased by CLIENT, Presidio shall invoice CLIENT once a month. Notwithstanding the amounts 
included on the applicable purchase order, the invoice for Usage-Based Services will vary from month to month based upon CLIENT’s usage and CLIENT shall be obligated to 
pay all charges for the Usage-Based Services used by CLIENT in the previous month. If CLIENT is delinquent in its payment obligations for the Usage-Based Services, then, 
upon reasonable, prior notice, Presidio reserves the right to suspend or discontinue such services at its sole discretion. CLIENT acknowledges and agrees that such 
discontinuation or suspension by PRESIDIO will not constitute a breach of PRESIDIO’S obligations to CLIENT.  CLIENT agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PRESIDIO for 
any resulting damages due to the suspension or discontinuation of the Usage-Based Services due to CLIENT’s delinquent or non-payment. 
• Enterprise Software, Licensing and Subscription Services (“Enterprise Agreement”). For Third-Party-provided, enterprise-based software licensing and services, Presidio shall 
invoice CLIENT according to the terms of the Enterprise Agreement between CLIENT and the Third Party. If CLIENT is delinquent in its payment obligations hereunder, then, 
upon reasonable, prior notice, Presidio reserves the right to suspend or discontinue such services at its sole discretion. CLIENT acknowledges and agrees that such 
discontinuation or suspension by PRESIDIO will not constitute a breach of PRESIDIO’S obligations to CLIENT.  CLIENT agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PRESIDIO for 
any resulting damages due to the suspension or discontinuation of the services due to CLIENT’s delinquent or non-payment. 
Freight, Handling, Shipping
• CLIENT will be billed for Presidio’s and/or the manufacturer’s freight charges for shipment of goods. 
• Title/Risk of loss passes to CLIENT Freight on Board (FOB) origin unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Presidio. Orders shipped from a manufacturer to Presidio at 
CLIENT request for warehousing, configuration, storage or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been shipped to CLIENT.
• Presidio accepts no responsibility / liability in connection with the shipment.  
• Goods held in a Presidio warehouse either a) at the CLIENT’s request or b) in the event CLIENT refuses to accept delivery, may be subject to warehousing fees.  Client may 
be asked to execute a Presidio “Warehousing Agreement”. CLIENT must provide primary insurance coverage for CLIENT equipment held in a Presidio warehouse.  
• International delivery services include (i) Consolidated billing in USD for all international deliveries (ii) Consolidated contracting with one entity, namely Presidio (iii) Single 
point of contact (iv) Freight forwarding including exportation permits, application of tariff headings, customs clearance (including import permits, licenses, certificates) (v) Asset 
Management, Tracking & Reporting.
Warranty and Limitation of Liability
• Product is warranted by the Manufacturer, not by Presidio. Please consult Manufacturer for warranty terms. IN NO EVENT SHALL PRESIDIO BE LIABLE TO CLIENT FOR 
ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR 
OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. PRESIDIO’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CLIENT’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DAMAGES 
FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NONPERFORMANCE OR MISREPRESENTATION, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF 
ACTIONS, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT WHICH HAS BEEN ACTUALLY PAID TO PRESIDIO BY CLIENT FOR PRODUCTS HEREUNDER.
Return Policy
• CLIENTS return rights are subject to the return policies (& fees including restocking) of the applicable manufacturer 
• A Presidio-issued Return Material Authorization (RMA) is required & needs to accompany returned items before any credit is issued to a CLIENT. Presidio reserves the right to 
deny RMA requests in the event the Manufacturer will not provide for an authorized return. If integration of product is performed at a Presidio facility, transfer of ownership 
occurs as of inception of integration regardless of shipment terms as manufacturers will not accept return of open product. 
• CLIENTS have 15 calendar days from original ship date to request a RMA (unless shorter period is required by manufacturer)
• Items returned must be in original shipping cartons, unopened, unused, undamaged and unaltered failing which Presidio is entitled to reject acceptance of items or charge 
further fees
• The CLIENT is responsible for shipping fees to the destination highlighted in the RMA
• Opened software cannot be returned
Cancellation Policy
• CLIENT’s cancellation of purchase order rights are subject to the cancellation policies (& fees) of the applicable manufacturer
Leases
• In the event Presidio does not receive payment for leased goods purchased on the CLIENT’s behalf from the applicable third-party financing entity, CLIENT is obligated to pay 
Presidio for all such goods as indicated in the applicable Presidio invoice. 
Software terms
• Software is subject to the license terms that accompany it. 
• License terms are established between the CLIENT & owner of the software
• Unless Presidio is the owner or licensor, Presidio makes no representations and/or warranties relating to its operation, ownership or use. 
• Delivery of software licenses are agreed to be accepted in electronic form from the third party software company.  Otherwise, you agree to self-accrue any applicable sales tax 
at the rate in effect for the jurisdiction. 
Term and Termination of Orders: Usage-Based Services, Enterprise Agreements and Multi-Year Orders 
• The terms of use for Usage-Based Services (i.e. Cisco-provided WebEx or Software as a Service (Saas)) are established by the applicable third-party provider of such 
services either at the applicable third-party provider website or via the separate agreement between CLIENT and third-party provider.  
• The “Initial Term” of an order for Usage-Based Services and/or and Enterprise Agreement (“Order”) starts on the date the Usage-Based Services and/or Enterprise Agreement 
are available for use by CLIENT and lasts for the time period stated in the Order. After the Initial Term, unless prohibited by applicable law, there will be an automatic “Renewal 
Term” of the same length of time unless CLIENT notifies Presidio in writing that CLIENT does not want to renew at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then current Initial 
Term or Renewal Term. If the fees will change for the Renewal Term, Presidio will notify CLIENT reasonably in advance of the Renewal and in time for CLIENT to accept or 
reject renewing the Usage-Based Services and/or Enterprise Agreement. If CLIENT agrees with the fee changes, CLIENT may do nothing and the new fees will apply for the 
upcoming Renewal Term. 
• Either party may terminate an Order by providing the other party written notice of termination at least sixty (60) days before the end of such Initial or Renewal Term. The 
termination will be effective on the last day of the Initial or Renewal Term and CLIENT will pay for the Usage-Based Services and/or Enterprise Agreement until the end of the 
current Initial or Renewal Term regardless of when CLIENT provided notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Usage-Based Services and Enterprise Agreements ordered are 
strictly non-cancelable during the Initial Term or Renewal Term except as otherwise provided in the applicable Service Terms and/or otherwise agreed upon in writing by 
Presidio. CLIENT will not be entitled to any refund for terminated Usage-Based Services or Enterprise Agreements during the Initial Term or Renewal Term except as agreed 
upon in writing by Provider and/or Presidio
 Multi-Year Agreements
• For multi-year agreements, CLIENT expressly agrees to enter into a binding, non-cancelable agreement per the billing schedule set forth in the quote.  THE CLIENT 
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE CLIENT’S AGREEMENT AND PAYMENTS FOR A MULTI-YEAR TRANSACTION ARE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE 
BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES FOR MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS, SUCH THAT PRESIDIO WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO A MULTI-YEAR 
TRANSACTION WITHOUT SUCH AGREEMENT

Attachment B 
Price Proposal 
 
Respondent shall provide a Price Proposal for each Solution proposed for a given Service Category. 
Pricing proposed shall be used by the Department to evaluate the Respondent’s Solution. Provide Price 
Proposals in a PDF file. Provision of a Price Proposal is a mandatory responsiveness requirement.  
 
Mandatory Requirements. On each Price Proposal submitted, Respondent shall, at a minimum: (1) 
state the applicable Service Category, (2) provide the name of the Solution proposed, and (3) provide 
pricing information for the proposed Solution for both the initial and renewal term. If no renewal pricing is 
proposed, Respondent affirms its submitted pricing for the initial term shall be applicable to any renewal 
terms.  
 
The Department prefers that Respondent’s pricing: 
 
1) Provides not-to-exceed pricing for initial term and renewal term of the Solution; and  
2) Provides Tiered Pricing, where greater numbers of units purchased provide discounted pricing.  
 
Provision of not-to-exceed pricing and tiered pricing is not a mandatory requirement, but will result in the 
Respondent receiving a higher Price Proposal score, as further explained in Attachment C, Evaluation 
Criteria. 
 
 
Add-On Services (OPTIONAL): Respondent may include the names, descriptions, and prices for Add-
On services for the proposed Solution in its Price Proposal. If the Solution has separate charges for 
implementation, integration, or other start-up costs, these must be included in the Add-On Services 
portion of the Respondent’s Price Proposal. For each Add-On Service proposed, Respondent shall 
describe the Add-On Service. Descriptions for each Add-On Service should be a maximum of 250 words. 
Failure to enter a name, description, and price for each proposed Add-On Service may result in that Add-
On Service not being made available on the Term Contract, if awarded. If the Renewal Term Add-On 
Services is not provided, Respondent affirms pricing for the Initial Term shall be applicable to any renewal 
terms. 
 
The Department reserves the right to seek clarification where necessary regarding all submitted Price 
Proposals. 
 
A sample Price Proposal is provided on the following page. Respondents are encouraged to utilize the 
sample to ensure that the requirements specified above are provided, but may utilize an alternative format 
that contains the required information.
