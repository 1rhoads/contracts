**Price Proposal**


Respondent: Network Digital Security, Inc.


Solution Proposed: HighWire EDR Managed Service


Service Category: Service Category 3: Endpoint Detection and Response


Tiered, not to exceed pricing for **initial** term: Available for 12-month, 24-month, 36-month options for
initial term.


The Quantification unit “devices” for L3 refers to devices with the end-point agent deployed. Endpoint
agents will be trued up on actual total deployed agents based on the maximum deployed licenses in the
console. An upper bound can be established to ensure the contracting party does not mistakenly jump
into the next tier. True-up to the next tier (ex. 1-50 > 51-150) will follow once curation efforts have been
completed. Includes basic onboarding.

**Price Proposal**


Respondent: Network Digital Security, Inc


Solution Proposed: HighWire Networks SASE Managed Service


Service Category: Service Category 10: Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)


Tiered, not to exceed pricing for **initial** term: Available for 12-month, 24-month, 36-month options for
initial term. Best effort has been taken to produce a rate-card for SASE that is accurate, however, the
realities of this service tier are dramatically more complex and dynamic. That said, these should serve
as good “worst case” bounds for general SASE. Each tier includes remote licenses for all users, HA
hardware for a site (or multiples in the case of the larger packages), appropriate bandwidth for fully
inspecting all remote and on-premises traffic, IPS/NGAM CASB and DLP. Significant modifications can
be made to that scope resulting is drastically different pricing options. The quantification “Users” is in
reference to human users that need remote access or remote security, given the scoping constraints
listed above.

**Price Proposal**


Respondent: Network Digital Security, Inc.


Solution Proposed: HighWire Networks Vulnerability Management Managed Service


Service Category: Service Category 13: Vulnerability Assessment and Management


Tiered, not to exceed pricing for **initial** term: Available for 12-month, 24-month, 36-month options for
initial term. The Quantification unit “Devices” for Vulnerability Assessment and Management refers to
services and devices discovered via the various scanning methodologies discuss in L1, L2 and L4
scanning services. Upper (maximum) bounds, along with scan target list curation, can be established
prior to deployment to ensure no overages are automatically charged. True-up to the next tier (ex. 1-50

- 51-150) will follow once the curation efforts are completed. Pricing in L13 and service deployment is
shared with L1, L2 and L4. Externally discoverable assets, Network-based and agent-based discovery
share the same platform in this proposed service. Includes basic onboarding. *Optional* items (Prompt
L13:P7) have been added to address the desire to patch discovered application vulnerabilities.
