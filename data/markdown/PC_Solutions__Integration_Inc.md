changes to user
privileges across
collaboration apps like
Slack and Zoom.
Abnormal Human
Behavior AI builds a
running inventory of
privilege changes across
Slack and Zoom,
including timestamps
and the humans
involved—determining
which changes may
present a risk and need
further investigation.
Abnormal admins can
drill into an individual
change to gain a before-
E-mail Like Security and-after view, giving
Posture Management insight into what the
normal state looked like
and how a given
application has been
affected. Abnormal also
provides links to the
PeopleBase profiles for
each user involved and
suggested next steps.
Abnormal sends
notifications so security
teams can acknowledge
changes, schedule email
notifications, export to
the SIEM, and follow
suggested next steps if a
privilege change
indicates a serious risk.

Attachment B
Price Proposal
Respondent shall provide a Price Proposal for each Solution proposed for a given Service
Category. Pricing proposed shall be used by the Department to evaluate the Respondent’s
Solution. Provide Price Proposals in a PDF file. Provision of a Price Proposal is a mandatory
responsiveness requirement.
Mandatory Requirements. On each Price Proposal submitted, Respondent shall, at a minimum:
(1)state the applicable Service Category, (2) provide the name of the Solution proposed, and (3)
provide pricing information for the proposed Solution for both the initial and renewal term. If no
renewal pricing is proposed, Respondent affirms its submitted pricing for the initial term shall be
applicable to any renewal terms.
The Department prefers that Respondent’s pricing:
1) Provides not-to-exceed pricing for initial term and renewal term of the Solution; and
2)Provides Tiered Pricing, where greater numbers of units purchased provide discounted
pricing.
Provision of not-to-exceed pricing and tiered pricing is not a mandatory requirement, but will result
in the Respondent receiving a higher Price Proposal score, as further explained in Attachment C,
Evaluation Criteria.
Add-On Services (OPTIONAL): Respondent may include the names, descriptions, and prices for
Add-On services for the proposed Solution in its Price Proposal. If the Solution has separate
charges for implementation, integration, or other start-up costs, these must be included in the
Add-On Services portion of the Respondent’s Price Proposal. For each Add-On Service
proposed, Respondent shall describe the Add-On Service. Descriptions for each Add-On Service
should be a maximum of 250 words. Failure to enter a name, description, and price for each
proposed Add-On Service may result in that Add-On Service not being made available on the
Term Contract, if awarded. If the Renewal Term Add-On Services is not provided, Respondent
affirms pricing for the Initial Term shall be applicable to any renewal terms.
The Department reserves the right to seek clarification where necessary regarding all submitted
Price Proposals.
A sample Price Proposal is provided on the following page. Respondents are encouraged to utilize
the sample to ensure that the requirements specified above are provided, but may utilize an
alternative format that contains the required information.
