Attachment B 
Price Proposal 
Respondent shall provide a Price Proposal for each Solution proposed for a given Service 
Category. Pricing proposed shall be used by the Department to evaluate the Respondent’s 
Solution. Provide Price Proposals in a PDF file. Provision of a Price Proposal is a mandatory 
responsiveness requirement.  
Mandatory Requirements. On each Price Proposal submitted, Respondent shall, at a minimum: 
(1) state the applicable Service Category, (2) provide the name of the Solution proposed, and (3)
provide pricing information for the proposed Solution for both the initial and renewal term. If no
renewal pricing is proposed, Respondent affirms its submitted pricing for the initial term shall be
applicable to any renewal terms.
The Department prefers that Respondent’s pricing: 
1) Provides not-to-exceed pricing for initial term and renewal term of the Solution; and
2) Provides Tiered Pricing, where greater numbers of units purchased provide discounted
pricing.
Provision of not-to-exceed pricing and tiered pricing is not a mandatory requirement, but will result 
in the Respondent receiving a higher Price Proposal score, as further explained in Attachment C, 
Evaluation Criteria. 
Add-On Services (OPTIONAL): Respondent may include the names, descriptions, and prices for 
Add-On services for the proposed Solution in its Price Proposal. If the Solution has separate 
charges for implementation, integration, or other start-up costs, these must be included in the 
Add-On Services portion of the Respondent’s Price Proposal. For each Add-On Service 
proposed, Respondent shall describe the Add-On Service. Descriptions for each Add-On Service 
should be a maximum of 250 words. Failure to enter a name, description, and price for each 
proposed Add-On Service may result in that Add-On Service not being made available on the 
Term Contract, if awarded. If the Renewal Term Add-On Services is not provided, Respondent 
affirms pricing for the Initial Term shall be applicable to any renewal terms. 
The Department reserves the right to seek clarification where necessary regarding all submitted 
Price Proposals. 
A sample Price Proposal is provided on the following page. Respondents are encouraged to utilize 
the sample to ensure that the requirements specified above are provided, but may utilize an 
alternative format that contains the required information.
