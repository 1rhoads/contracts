Cloud-native API 
architecture centralizes 
cloud visibility by 
enabling a simple 
integration to any cloud 
app in under five 
minutes with only a few 
clicks. Human behavior 
AI automatically 
monitors authentication 
signals, 
communications, and 
notable activity, such as 
unusual locations, IPs, 
or VPNs or new MFA 
device registrations, 
across all integrated 
platforms—enhancing 
behavioral models 
without the need for rule 
or policy creation. 
Automatically identifies 
compromised identities, 
generating a contextual 
behavioral case timeline 
to enable investigation of 
notable events. 
Automates remediation, 
immediately terminating 
sessions and revoking 
account access across 
cloud entities once an 
account takeover is 
confirmed.

Monitor high-impact 
changes to user 
privileges across 
collaboration apps like 
Slack and Zoom. 
Abnormal Human 
Behavior AI builds a 
running inventory of 
privilege changes across 
Slack and Zoom, 
including timestamps 
and the humans 
involved—determining 
which changes may 
present a risk and need 
further investigation. 
Abnormal admins can 
drill into an individual 
change to gain a before-
and-after view, giving 
insight into what the 
normal state looked like 
and how a given 
application has been 
affected. Abnormal also 
provides links to the 
PeopleBase profiles for 
each user involved and 
suggested next steps. 
Abnormal sends 
notifications so security 
teams can acknowledge 
changes, schedule email 
notifications, export to 
the SIEM, and follow 
suggested next steps if a 
privilege change 
indicates a serious risk.
