Attachment B
Price Proposal
Respondent shall provide a Price Proposal for each Solution proposed for a given Service
Category. Pricing proposed shall be used by the Department to evaluate the Respondent’s
Solution. Provide Price Proposals in a PDF file. Provision of a Price Proposal is a mandatory
responsiveness requirement.
Mandatory Requirements. On each Price Proposal submitted, Respondent shall, at a minimum:
(1) state the applicable Service Category, (2) provide the name of the Solution proposed, and (3)
provide pricing information for the proposed Solution for both the initial and renewal term. If no
renewal pricing is proposed, Respondent affirms its submitted pricing for the initial term shall be
applicable to any renewal terms.
The Department prefers that Respondent’s pricing:
1) Provides not-to-exceed pricing for initial term and renewal term of the Solution; and
2)Provides Tiered Pricing, where greater numbers of units purchased provide discounted
pricing.
Provision of not-to-exceed pricing and tiered pricing is not a mandatory requirement, but will result
in the Respondent receiving a higher Price Proposal score, as further explained in Attachment C,
Evaluation Criteria.
Add-On Services (OPTIONAL): Respondent may include the names, descriptions, and prices for
Add-On services for the proposed Solution in its Price Proposal. If the Solution has separate
charges for implementation, integration, or other start-up costs, these must be included in the
Add-On Services portion of the Respondent’s Price Proposal. For each Add-On Service proposed,
Respondent shall describe the Add-On Service. Descriptions for each Add-On Service should be
a maximum of 250 words. Failure to enter a name, description, and price for each proposed Add-
On Service may result in that Add-On Service not being made available on the Term Contract, if
awarded. If the Renewal Term Add-On Services is not provided, Respondent affirms pricing for
the Initial Term shall be applicable to any renewal terms.
The Department reserves the right to seek clarification where necessary regarding all submitted
Price Proposals.
A sample Price Proposal is provided on the following page. Respondents are encouraged to utilize
the sample to ensure that the requirements specified above are provided, but may utilize an
alternative format that contains the required information.
