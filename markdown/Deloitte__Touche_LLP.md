Implementation Services 
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and conﬁguration process 
using customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a ﬁxed price per sprint 
basis. The sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a 
composition of the following roles based on the project requirements deﬁned with the customer 
and serves as the basis for the cost calculation:  
•
Project manager/scrum master
•
Architect
•
System engineer (s)
•
System tester (s)
•
Business analyst (s)
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task 
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is ﬂexible. Deloitte will work with the 
customer to estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and conﬁguration 
requirements (scope) such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access 
limitations, false positive tuning based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools 
integration.    
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In 
the event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s 
Services and ultimately accepted by the Customer.   
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5 
sprints = $232,385.00

Add-on services description: 
Implementation Services 
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and conﬁguration process using 
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a ﬁxed price per sprint basis. The 
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a composition of the 
following roles based on the project requirements deﬁned with the customer and serves as the basis for 
the cost calculation:  
•
Project manager/scrum master
•
Architect
•
System engineer (s)
•
System tester (s)
•
Business analyst (s)
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task requiring 
12-16 hours of eﬀort. The duration of a sprint is ﬂexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to estimate
the story points based on customer’s implementation and conﬁguration requirements (scope) such as
number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning based on
customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the 
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and 
ultimately accepted by the Customer.   
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5 sprints 
= $232,385.00

Implementation Services 
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration process using 
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The 
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a composition of the 
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for 
the cost calculation:  
Project manager/scrum master 
Architect  
System engineer (s)  
System tester (s)  
Business analyst (s)   
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task 
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to 
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope) 
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning 
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.    
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the 
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and 
ultimately accepted by the Customer.

Add-on services description: 
Implementation Services 
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration process using 
customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed price per sprint basis. The 
sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a composition of the 
following roles based on the project requirements defined with the customer and serves as the basis for 
the cost calculation:  
Project manager/scrum master 
Architect  
System engineer (s)  
System tester (s)  
Business analyst (s)   
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task 
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to 
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope) 
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning 
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.    
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the 
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and 
ultimately accepted by the Customer.   
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5 
sprints =  $232,385.00

tuning, tickets managed, incident response timeframe and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).    
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the 
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and 
ultimately accepted by the Customer.   
Example: For a scope that involves 80 story points with be estimated at $38,776.00 (sprint cost) * 8 
sprints =  $310,208.00

Implementation Services 
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and configuration 
process using customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a fixed 
price per sprint basis. The sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, 
that includes a composition of the following roles based on the project requirements defined with 
the customer and serves as the basis for the cost calculation:  
Project manager/scrum master 
Architect  
System engineer (s)  
System tester (s)  
Business analyst (s)   
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a 
task requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Vendor will work with the 
customer to estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration 
requirements (scope) such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access 
limitations, false positive tuning based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools 
integration.    
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. 
In the event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for vendor’s 
Services and ultimately accepted by the Customer.   
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) 
* 5 sprints =  $232,385.00

Add-on services description: 
Implementation Services 
Customers may elect to engage with Deloitte in an Agile implementation and conﬁguration process 
using customer tools or Deloitte managed solutions and pay for Services on a ﬁxed price per sprint 
basis. The sprint team is comprised of both dedicated and shared resources, that includes a 
composition of the following roles based on the project requirements deﬁned with the customer 
and serves as the basis for the cost calculation:  
•
Project manager/scrum master
•
Architect
•
System engineer (s)
•
System tester (s)
•
Business analyst (s)
A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task 
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is ﬂexible. Deloitte will work with the 
customer to estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and conﬁguration 
requirements (scope) such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access 
limitations, false positive tuning based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools 
integration.    
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In 
the event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s 
Services and ultimately accepted by the Customer.   
Example: For a scope that involves 50 story points with be estimated at $46,477.00 (sprint cost) * 5 
sprints = $232,385.00

A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task 
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to 
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope) 
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning 
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.     
Customers can procure additional sprint teams to further scale up or down the team as needed. In the 
event a Service Proposal is terminated, Customer shall pay all amounts due for Deloitte’s Services and

the cost calculation:  
•
Project manager/scrum master
•

A sprint team will deliver ten story points in one sprint. A story point is a unit of measure for a task 
requiring 12-16 hours of effort. The duration of a sprint is flexible. Deloitte will work with the customer to 
estimate the story points based on customer’s implementation and configuration requirements (scope) 
such as number of endpoints, data separation considerations, access limitations, false positive tuning 
based on customer’s technology landscape and ticketing tools integration.
