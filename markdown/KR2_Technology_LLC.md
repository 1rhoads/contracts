Abuse Mailbox/AI 
Security Mailbox
Provides 24/7 AI triage 
to autonomously 
inspect and judge user-
reported emails as 
malicious, spam, safe,

other unreported emails 
within the same 
phishing campaign 
instantly. Responds to 
every reported email 
with AI-powered 
explanations that 
provide detailed 
explanations. 
Employees can also 
ask follow-up or other 
security related 
questions, offering them 
a delightful and helpful 
experience. Organizes 
all user-reported emails 
in one place and 
provides full visibility 
into each submission. 
Administrators can see 
the full attack context 
for each campaign and 
every email. Integrates 
with existing end-user 
phishing reporting 
buttons, SIEM/SOAR 
solutions, and ticketing 
system workflows to 
enable centralized 
alerts for SOC analysts.

Attachment B 
Price Proposal 
Respondent shall provide a Price Proposal for each Solution proposed for a given Service 
Category. Pricing proposed shall be used by the Department to evaluate the Respondent’s 
Solution. Provide Price Proposals in a PDF file. Provision of a Price Proposal is a mandatory 
responsiveness requirement.  
Mandatory Requirements. On each Price Proposal submitted, Respondent shall, at a 
minimum: (1) state the applicable Service Category, (2) provide the name of the Solution 
proposed, and (3) provide pricing information for the proposed Solution for both the initial and 
renewal term. If no renewal pricing is proposed, Respondent affirms its submitted pricing for the 
initial term shall be applicable to any renewal terms.  
The Department prefers that Respondent’s pricing: 
1) Provides not-to-exceed pricing for initial term and renewal term of the Solution; and
2) Provides Tiered Pricing, where greater numbers of units purchased provide
discounted pricing.
Provision of not-to-exceed pricing and tiered pricing is not a mandatory requirement, but will 
result in the Respondent receiving a higher Price Proposal score, as further explained in 
Attachment C, Evaluation Criteria. 
Add-On Services (OPTIONAL): Respondent may include the names, descriptions, and prices 
for Add-On services for the proposed Solution in its Price Proposal. If the Solution has separate 
charges for implementation, integration, or other start-up costs, these must be included in the 
Add-On Services portion of the Respondent’s Price Proposal. For each Add-On Service 
proposed, Respondent shall describe the Add-On Service. Descriptions for each Add-On 
Service should be a maximum of 250 words. Failure to enter a name, description, and price for 
each proposed Add-On Service may result in that Add-On Service not being made available on 
the Term Contract, if awarded. If the Renewal Term Add-On Services is not provided, 
Respondent affirms pricing for the Initial Term shall be applicable to any renewal terms. 
The Department reserves the right to seek clarification where necessary regarding all submitted 
Price Proposals. 
A sample Price Proposal is provided on the following page. Respondents are encouraged to 
utilize the sample to ensure that the requirements specified above are provided, but may utilize 
an alternative format that contains the required information.
