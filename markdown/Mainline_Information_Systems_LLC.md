*Armis for Asset Management consolidates asset data into one complete, de-duplicated and authoritative 
asset map. Creates a complete asset inventory of all asset types from the ground to the cloud ensuring 
the entire attack surface is both defended and managed in real time. Complete visibility into assets 
behaviors and risk management based on business context, threat and vulnerability insights and the 
collective intelligence of billions of assets monitored by the Armis Asset Intelligence Engine. Asset 
minimum 2000 per tenant. Network ports also known as collectors.
