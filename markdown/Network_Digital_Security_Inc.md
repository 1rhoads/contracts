 Price Proposal

Service Category: Service Category 3: Endpoint Detection and Response 
Tiered, not to exceed pricing for initial term: Available for 12-month, 24-month, 36-month options for 
initial term.   
The Quantification unit “devices” for L3 refers to devices with the end-point agent deployed.  Endpoint 
agents will be trued up on actual total deployed agents based on the maximum deployed licenses in the 
console.  An upper bound can be established to ensure the contracting party does not mistakenly jump 
into the next tier.  True-up to the next tier (ex. 1-50 > 51-150) will follow once curation efforts have been 
completed. Includes basic onboarding.

Price Proposal 
Respondent: Network Digital Security, Inc 
Solution Proposed: HighWire Networks SASE Managed Service 
Service Category: Service Category 10: Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) 
Tiered, not to exceed pricing for initial term: Available for 12-month, 24-month, 36-month options for 
initial term.  Best effort has been taken to produce a rate-card for SASE that is accurate, however, the 
realities of this service tier are dramatically more complex and dynamic.  That said, these should serve 
as good “worst case” bounds for general SASE.  Each tier includes remote licenses for all users, HA 
hardware for a site (or multiples in the case of the larger packages), appropriate bandwidth for fully 
inspecting all remote and on-premises traffic, IPS/NGAM CASB and DLP.  Significant modifications can 
be made to that scope resulting is drastically different pricing options.  The quantification “Users” is in 
reference to human users that need remote access or remote security, given the scoping constraints 
listed above.

Service Category: Service Category 13: Vulnerability Assessment and Management  
Tiered, not to exceed pricing for initial term: Available for 12-month, 24-month, 36-month options for 
initial term.  The Quantification unit “Devices” for Vulnerability Assessment and Management refers to 
services and devices discovered via the various scanning methodologies discuss in L1, L2 and L4 
scanning services.  Upper (maximum) bounds, along with scan target list curation, can be established 
prior to deployment to ensure no overages are automatically charged.  True-up to the next tier (ex. 1-50 
> 51-150) will follow once the curation efforts are completed.  Pricing in L13 and service deployment is
shared with L1, L2 and L4.  Externally discoverable assets, Network-based and agent-based discovery
share the same platform in this proposed service. Includes basic onboarding. *Optional* items (Prompt
