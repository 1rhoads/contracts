Identity Governance 
Okta Identity Governance streamlines user access oversight by automating reviews, 
certifications, and approval processes. It ensures compliance with regulations and reduces risks 
by giving organizations full visibility and control over access policies. 
Workflow 
Okta Workflow is a no-code automation platform that connects identity events to IT and 
business processes. It enables organizations to create custom workflows for user provisioning, 
deprovisioning, and notifications without writing code, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors. 
Lifecycle Management (LCM) 
Okta LCM automates the onboarding and offboarding of users across all systems, ensuring the 
right access is provisioned or revoked. It integrates seamlessly with HR systems, reducing 
manual efforts and improving security. 
Device Access 
Okta Device Access secures access to enterprise resources by enforcing policies on enrolled 
devices. It ensures only trusted devices can access sensitive data, bolstering endpoint security 
in zero-trust environments. 
Access Gateway 
Okta Access Gateway extends modern identity capabilities to on-premise applications. It 
integrates legacy systems with Okta's cloud-based authentication, enabling a hybrid approach 
to identity management. 
Identity Threat Protection (ITP) 
Okta ITP safeguards against identity-based attacks by detecting and mitigating threats like 
phishing and credential stuffing. It leverages contextual signals, adaptive policies, and advanced 
threat intelligence. 
Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) 
Okta ISPM provides continuous monitoring and assessment of identity configurations. It 
identifies and addresses vulnerabilities to maintain a secure identity environment and align with 
zero-trust principles.
